    """Capture additional details for the function evaluator.

    Function evaluators (see [`Evaluator`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.Evaluator])
    primarily receive variable vectors to evaluate objective and constraint
    functions. However, they may also benefit from additional information to
    optimize their calculations. This `EvaluatorContext` object provides that
    supplementary information.

    Specifically, it provides:

    - The configuration object for the current optimization step.
    - A boolean vector (`active`) indicating which variable rows require
      evaluation.
    - The realization index for each variable vector. This can be used to
      determine the correct function from an ensemble to use with each variable
      vector.
    - The perturbation index for each variable vector (if applicable). A value
      less than 0 indicates that the vector is not a perturbation.

    Attributes:
        config:             Configuration of the optimizer.
        active:             Indicates which variable rows require evaluation.
        realizations:       Realization numbers for each requested evaluation.
        perturbations:      Perturbation numbers for each requested evaluation.
                            A value less than 0 indicates that the vector is
                            not a perturbation.

        This method filters a one- or two-dimensional array by retaining only

    This class stores the results of evaluating objective and constraint

    The `objectives` and `constraints` are stored as matrices. Each column in
    these matrices corresponds to a specific objective or constraint, and each
    row corresponds to a variable vector.

    When the evaluator is asked to evaluate functions, some variable vectors may
    be marked as inactive. The results for these inactive vectors should be set
    to zero. All active variable vectors should be evaluated. If an evaluation
    fails for any reason, the corresponding values should be set to `numpy.nan`.

    A `batch_id` can be set to identify this specific set of evaluation results.

    The `evaluation_info` dictionary can store additional metadata for each
    evaluation. This information is not used internally by `ropt` and can have
    an arbitrary structure, to be interpreted by the application. This can be
    used, for example, to uniquely identify the results calculated for each
    variable vector, allowing them to be linked back to their corresponding
    input vectors.

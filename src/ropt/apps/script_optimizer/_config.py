class ScriptOptimizerConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration of a ScriptOptimizer object.

    This configuration class defines a number of parameters that determine how
    the optimizer runs:

    - The working directory where the various files that the application needs
      is defined by `work_dir`.
    - The directory where the files generated by the individual evaluation jobs
      are placed is determined by the `job_dir`. If `job_dir` is `None` is set
      equal to `work_dir`. If `job_dir` is a relative path, it is set relative
      to `work_dir`.
    - Individual evaluation jobs are assigned a label, which is used to generate
      the name of the directory in `job_dir` where the files that they place are
      generated. The `job_labels` attribute is a tuple of strings that indicates
      the names of the nested directories that are generated. The string may
      contain Python replacement fields to generate specific names:
        - `batch` is replaced by the batch ID.
        - `realization` is replaced by the realization name.
        - `job` is replaced by the job ID
    - Each evaluation job receives a set of variables, written as json file with
      a name given by the `var_filename` attribute.

    Attributes:
        work_dir:     Working directory
        job_dir:      The directory to store files generated during optimization
        job_labels:   Label formats to use in generating filenames reports

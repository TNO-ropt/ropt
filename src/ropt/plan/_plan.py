class Plan:
    """Plan class for executing optimization workflows.

    The `Plan` object is the core component for executing optimization workflows.
    It orchestrates the execution of individual steps, manages evaluators for
    function computations, and processes data and results through event handlers.

    **Building a Plan:**

    A `Plan` is constructed by adding three main types of components, typically
    instantiated via the [`PluginManager`][ropt.plugins.PluginManager]:

    1.  **Steps ([`PlanStep`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.PlanStep]):** These define
        individual actions or operations within the optimization workflow. Steps
        are added using the [`add_step`][ropt.plan.Plan.add_step] method.
    2.  **Event Handlers ([`EventHandler`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.EventHandler]):**
        These components process data, track results, or react to events
        emitted during plan execution. Event handlers are added using the
        [`add_event_handler`][ropt.plan.Plan.add_event_handler] method.
    3.  **Evaluators ([`Evaluator`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.Evaluator]):** These
        are responsible for performing function evaluations (e.g., objective
        functions, constraints). Evaluators are added using the
        [`add_evaluator`][ropt.plan.Plan.add_evaluator] method and can be
        passed to steps that need them.

    **Tags:**

    Steps, event handlers, and evaluators can be assigned one or more tags.
    These tags can be used to identify the components instead of their unique
    IDs. Unlike ID's, tags do not need to be unique. This is useful when the
    components are created dynamically or if multiple components are to be
    identified as a group. For example, when specifying the source of events
    that a handler should process, its `sources` argument may contain both
    component objects, which identifies by their ID, or tags, which could refer
    to multiple components that have that tag.

    **Executing a Plan:**

    Once a plan is assembled, the [`run`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.PlanStep.run]
    method can be invoked for each step individually. This approach allows for
    the integration of complex logic and custom functions, leveraging the full
    capabilities of Python.

    **PluginManager:**

    A [`PluginManager`][ropt.plugins.PluginManager] object can be provided that
    is used by the plan object to find and instantiate step, event handler, and
    evaluator objects. This manager can also be used by these components to
    implement further plugin-based functionality.

    **Events:**

    Steps can communicate events by retrieving a list of handlers using the
    [`get_event_handlers`][ropt.plan.Plan.get_event_handlers] method. Event
    handlers can respond to these events, enabling actions such as processing
    optimization results. Event handlers are added to the plan using the
    [`add_event_handler`][ropt.plan.Plan.add_event_handler] method. To connect
    the event handlers to steps, they generally accept a set of steps via the
    `sources` argument. The steps must be part of the same plan, or a child plan
    (if existent).

    **Evaluators:**

    Evaluators ([`Evaluator`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.Evaluator]) are key
    components responsible for performing function evaluations, such as
    computing objective functions or constraint values. They are added to the
    plan using the [`add_evaluator`][ropt.plan.Plan.add_evaluator] method. They
    connect to the steps in the plan, or in child plans, via the `clients`
    argument.

    **Nested Plans:**

    Multiple plans can be defined. A step within one plan can trigger the
    execution of another plan, enabling nested workflows. In nested plans, the
    [`set_parent`][ropt.plan.Plan.set_parent] method establishes a parent-child
    relationship. This allows events to propagate up the hierarchy to the parent
    plan.

    **Aborting a Plan:**

    A plan's execution can be terminated, either programmatically from within a
    step or event handler, or externally by directly calling the
    [`abort`][ropt.plan.Plan.abort] method. The
    [`aborted`][ropt.plan.Plan.aborted] property can be used to check if a plan
    has been aborted.

    **Handler Data:**

    Individual event handlers may store values that they accumulate or calculate
    from the events that they handle. Code outside of the event handlers, such
    as the optimization workflow code that runs the steps, can set and retrieve
    these values using the `[]` operator.

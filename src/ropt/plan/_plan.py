        """Initialize a plan object.

        This method initializes a plan using a `PlanConfig` object and an
        [`OptimizerContext`][ropt.plan.OptimizerContext] object. An optional
        [`plugin_manager`][ropt.plugins.PluginManager] argument allows for the
        specification of custom plugins for result handlers and step objects
        within the plan. If omitted, only plugins installed through Python's
        standard entry points are used.

        Plans can spawn additional plans within their workflow, with each
        spawned plan receiving a reference to its parent plan via the `parent`
        argument.

        Plan hierarchies are tracked using the `plan_id` attribute, a tuple of
        integers. A directly created plan has `plan_id == (0,)`. When a plan
        spawns a new plan with the [`spawn`][ropt.plan.Plan.spawn] method, the
        child receives an incremental index appended to its parent's `plan_id`,
        forming a unique sequence that reflects both the order of creation and
        nesting. This structure enables efficient tracing across both sequential
        and nested plan workflows.

        If the `optimizer_context` objects has variables defined, these are
        copied into the plan and available under the name they were added to the
        context. These variables can then be modified, but when spawning new
        plans, the new plan will have the original values for these variables.

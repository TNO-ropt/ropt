class BasicOptimizer:
    """A class for executing single optimization runs.

    The `BasicOptimizer` is designed to simplify the process of setting up and
    executing optimization workflows that consist primarily of a single
    optimization run. It offers a more streamlined approach compared to directly
    defining and managing a full `Plan` object, making it ideal for
    straightforward optimization tasks.

    This class provides a user-friendly interface for common optimization
    operations, including:

    - **Initiating a Single Optimization:**  Easily start an optimization
      process with a provided configuration and evaluator.
    - **Observing Optimization Events:** Register observer functions to monitor
      and react to various events that occur during the optimization, such as
      the start of an evaluation or the availability of new results.
    - **Abort Conditions:** Define a callback function that can be used to check
      for abort conditions during the optimization.
    - **Result Reporting:** Define a callback function that will be called
      whenever new results become available.
    - **Accessing Results:** After the optimization is complete, the optimal
      results, corresponding variables, and the optimization's exit code are
      readily accessible.
    - **Customizable Steps and Handlers:** While designed for single runs, it
      allows for the addition of custom plan steps and event handlers to the
      underlying `Plan` for more complex scenarios.

    By encapsulating the core elements of an optimization run, the
    `BasicOptimizer` reduces the boilerplate code required for simple
    optimization tasks, allowing users to focus on defining the optimization
    problem and analyzing the results.

        """Initialize a `BasicOptimizer` object.

        This constructor sets up the necessary components for a single
        optimization run. It requires an optimization configuration, optional
        domain transforms, and an evaluator, which together define the
        optimization problem and how to evaluate potential solutions. If a
        constraint value is within the `constraint_tolerance` of zero, it is
        considered satisfied. The `kwargs` may be used to define custom steps
        and event handlers to modify the behavior of the optimization process.

        Note: Custom  steps
            The optional keyword arguments (`kwargs`) provide a mechanism to
            inject a custom step into the optimization process. The behavior is
            as follows:

            1.  **Custom Step Execution:** If a single keyword argument is
                provided, the `BasicOptimizer` checks if a step with the same
                name exists. If so, that step is executed immediately, receiving
                the key-value pair as a keyword input, in addition to the
                evaluator function (via the `evaluator` keyword). Only one
                custom step can be executed this way, if other keyword arguments
                are present an error is raised. The custom step receives the
                `Plan` object and may return a custom function to execute.
            2.  **Default Optimization:** If no custom step is run, or if the
                custom step does not return a custom run function, the default
                optimization process is used.
            3.  **Callback Installation and Execution:** Finally, any callbacks
                added via `set_abort_callback` or `set_results_callback` are
                installed, and the appropriate run function is executed.

        The optimizer callback expects a vector or matrix with variables to
        evaluate. Discrete optimizers may request function evaluations for
        multiple variable vectors, passed as the rows of a matrix.
        Gradient-based methods may currently only pass a single variable vector
        at a time.

        The `return_functions` and `return_gradients` flags determine whether
        functions and/or gradients are to be evaluated. The results are returned
        as a tuple of arrays, one for functions and constraints, the other for
        gradients. If one of `return_functions` or `return_gradients` is
        `False`, the corresponding result is an empty array.

        Multiple function evaluations are returned as a matrix where the rows
        are the result vectors for each evaluation. The first element of a
        result vector is the value of the objective value, and the remaining
        elements are the values of the non-linear constraints.

        The gradients of the objective function and the non-linear constraints
        are returned as a matrix. The first row contains the gradient of the
        objective function, while the remaining rows contain the gradients of
        the non-linear constraints. Gradient-based methods currently support
        only a single evaluation, hence there is also only a single result.

        In most cases, the optimizer cannot handle failed function evaluations,
        which are indicated by `NaN` values. Some optimizers, in particular
        those that use multiple function evaluations do determine a next step
        are robust in this regard. By returning `allow_nan=True`, these
        optimizers can indicate that this is the case.

        Args:
            variables:        The variable vector or matrix to evaluate
            return_functions: If `True`, evaluate and return functions
            return_gradients: If `True`, evaluate and return gradients
            allow_nan:        If `True`, accept `NaN` values

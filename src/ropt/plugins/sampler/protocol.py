        The variable values are stored along the last axis, for each realization
        and perturbation. The first axis indexes the realization, and the second
        axis indexes the perturbation.

        If the `shared` flag is set in the
        [`SamplerConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.SamplerConfig] configuration, the
        first dimension should have a length equal to one, since all
        realizations will use the same set of perturbations.

        The sampler may handle only a subset of the variables, as specified by
        the `variable_indices` argument of the constructor. In this case, only
        the corresponding values along the variables axis (the last axis) should
        be set, while other values should be zero.

        Note: Sample scaling
            Samples will be multiplied by the values given by the

            [`gradients`][ropt.config.enopt.GradientConfig] section of the
            optimizer configuration. It makes therefore sense to generate
            samples that have an order of magnitude around one. For instance, by
            generating them on a `[-1, 1]` range, or with a unit standard
            deviation.

        The variable values are stored along the last axis, for each realization
        and perturbation. The first axis indexes the realization, and the second
        axis indexes the perturbation.

        If the `shared` flag is set in the
        [`SamplerConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.SamplerConfig] configuration, the
        first dimension should have a length equal to one, since all
        realizations will use the same set of perturbations.

        The sampler may handle only a subset of the variables, as specified by
        the `variable_indices` argument of the constructor. In this case, only
        the corresponding values along the variables axis (the last axis) should
        be set, while other values should be zero.

            samples that have an order of magnitude around one. For instance, by
            generating them on a `[-1, 1]` range, or with a unit standard
            deviation.

"""This module defines the abstract base class for realization filters.

Realization filters can be added via the plugin mechanism to implement
additional ways to filter the realizations that are used to calculate functions
and gradients. Any object that derives from the
[`RealizationFilter`][ropt.plugins.realization_filter.base.RealizationFilter]
abstract base class may be installed as a plugin.

    This method sorts realizations based on a weighted sum of objective function

    How it works:

    1. A weighted sum is calculated for each realization using the objective
       values specified by the `sort` indices and the corresponding weights
       from the main [`EnOptConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.EnOptConfig]. If only
       one objective index is provided in `sort`, no weighting is applied.
    2. Realizations are sorted based on this calculated value (ascending).
    3. Realizations whose rank falls within the range [`first`, `last`]
       (inclusive) are selected.
    4. The original weights (from `EnOptConfig.realizations.weights`) of the
       selected realizations are retained; all other realizations receive a
       weight of zero. Failed realizations (NaN objective values) are effectively
       given the lowest rank and are excluded before selection.

    most severely violate or are furthest from satisfying the constraint.

    How it works:

    1. The values of the constraint function specified by the `sort` index are
       retrieved for each realization. These values typically represent the
       constraint function evaluated minus its right-hand-side value (e.g.,
       `g(x) - rhs`).
    2. Realizations are conceptually sorted based on how "badly" they perform
       with respect to the constraint type:
        - **LE (`<=`) constraints:** Realizations with the *largest* positive
          values (most violated) are considered the worst.
        - **GE (`>=`) constraints:** Realizations with the *smallest* negative
          values (most violated) are considered the worst.

class DefaultRealizationFilter(RealizationFilter):
    """The default implementation for realization filtering strategies.

    This class provides several methods for calculating realization weights based
    on objective or constraint values. The specific method and its parameters
    are configured via the
    [`RealizationFilterConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.RealizationFilterConfig]
    in the main [`EnOptConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.EnOptConfig].

    **Supported Methods:**

    - `sort-objective`:
        Sorts realizations based on a weighted sum of specified objective
        function values. It then assigns zero weights to realizations outside of
        a defined index range (`first` to `last`) in the sorted list. Requires
        options defined by
        [`SortObjectiveOptions`][ropt.plugins.realization_filter.default.SortObjectiveOptions].

    - `sort-constraint`:
        Sorts realizations based on the value of a single specified constraint
        function. It assigns zero weights to realizations outside of a defined
        index range (`first` to `last`) in the sorted list. Requires options
        defined by
        [`SortConstraintOptions`][ropt.plugins.realization_filter.default.SortConstraintOptions].

    - `cvar-objective`:
        Calculates realization weights using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)
        method applied to a weighted sum of specified objective function values.
        Weights are assigned based on a specified `percentile` of the worst-performing
        realizations (highest objective values for minimization). Interpolation is
        used if the percentile boundary falls between realizations.
        Requires options defined by
        [`CVaRObjectiveOptions`][ropt.plugins.realization_filter.default.CVaRObjectiveOptions].

    - `cvar-constraint`:
        Calculates realization weights using the CVaR method applied to the
        value of a single specified constraint function. Weights are assigned
        based on a specified `percentile` of the worst-performing realizations
        (definition of "worst" depends on the constraint type: LE, GE, or EQ).
        Interpolation is used if the percentile boundary falls between
        realizations.
        Requires options defined by
        [`CVaRConstraintOptions`][ropt.plugins.realization_filter.default.CVaRConstraintOptions].

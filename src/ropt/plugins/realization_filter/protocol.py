"""This module defines the protocol to be followed by realization filters.

Realization filters can be added via the plugin mechanism to implement
additional ways to filter the realizations that are used to calculate functions
and gradients. Any object that follows the
[`RealizationFilter`][ropt.plugins.realization_filter.protocol.RealizationFilterProtocol]
protocol may be installed as a plugin.

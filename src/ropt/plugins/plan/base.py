"""This module defines the base classes for optimization plan plugins.

Optimization plan steps and result handlers can be added via the plugin
mechanism to implement additional functionality. This is done by creating a
plugin class that derives from the
[`PlanPlugin`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.PlanPlugin] class. It needs to define a
[`create`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.PlanPlugin.create] method that generates the
plan objects.

    This base class serves as the foundation for all plugins used in an

    derived from this class can be built-in, installed via a plugin mechanism,
    or dynamically loaded. During the execution of an optimization plan, the

    `create` function to instantiate either a

    Note: Plan functions
        A plan plugin can also provide functions to be used by the plan`s
        expression evaluator. To achieve this, the plugin should override the
        `functions` property of the
        [`PlanPlugin`][ropt.plugins.plan.base.PlanPlugin] class. This property
        should return a dictionary that maps function names to callables, which
        are subsequently added to the expression evaluator.

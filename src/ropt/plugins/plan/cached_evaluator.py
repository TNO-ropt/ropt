class DefaultCachedEvaluator(Evaluator):
    """An evaluator that caches results to avoid redundant computations.

    This evaluator attempts to retrieve previously computed function results
    from a cache before delegating to another evaluator. The cache is populated
    from `FunctionResults` objects stored by `EventHandler` instances specified
    as `sources`.

    When an evaluation is requested, for each variable vector and its
    corresponding realization, this evaluator searches through the `results`
    attribute of its `sources`. If a `FunctionResults` object is found where the
    `variables` match the input (within a small tolerance) and the `realization`
    also matches, the cached `objectives` and `constraints` from that
    `FunctionResults` object are used.

    If some, but not all, requested evaluations are found in the cache, this
    evaluator will mark the cached ones as inactive for the next evaluator in
    the chain and then call that evaluator to compute only the missing results.
    The final combined results (cached and newly computed) are then returned.

    This is particularly useful in scenarios where the same variable sets might
    be evaluated multiple times, for example, in iterative optimization
    algorithms or when restarting optimizations.

        """Evaluate objective and constraint functions, utilizing a cache.

        This method implements the core evaluation logic. It returns not only
        the evaluation results but also the function results that were retrieved
        from cache. The `eval` method in this class does not utilize these
        indices. However, derived classes can overload `eval` and use this
        information to add further details to the results, such as populating
        the `evaluation_info` attribute of an `EvaluatorResult`.

        The cache hits that are returned consists of a dictionary where the keys
        are the indices of the variable vectors that were found in the cache,
        and the values are tuples containing the realization index of the cached
        vectors and the corresponding `FunctionResults` object. This allows the
        caller to know which evaluations were retrieved from cache and which
        were computed anew. The cached evaluations can then be retrieved from
        the `FunctionResults` object, using the realization index.

        Note:
            If the object was initialized with realization names, these are used
            to match the realizations of the requested evaluations, with those
            in the cached results. This means that the results may originate
            from a different optimization run, as long as the realization names
            are still valid. However, in this case the results used for finding
            cached values must also store the realization names, otherwise the
            cached results will not be found.

            If the configuration does not contain realization names, the
            realization indices are used to match the realizations of the
            requested evaluations. In this case the indices of the realizations
            in the cached results must match those of the requested evaluations,
            i.e. they must have been specified in the same order in the
            respective configurations.

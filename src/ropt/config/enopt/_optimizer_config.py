class OptimizerConfig(EnOptBaseModel):
    """The configuration class for optimizers used in the optimization.

    This class defines the configuration for optimizers, configured by the
    `optimizer` field in an [`EnOptConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.EnOptConfig]
    object.

    Although there may be significant differences in the parameters that can be
    used for different optimization methods, there are a few standard settings
    defined in this configuration object, which are forwarded to the optimizer:

    - The maximum number of iterations allowed before the optimization should be
      aborted by this optimizer. The optimizer may choose to ignore this option.
    - The maximum number of function evaluations allowed before the optimization
      is aborted.
    - The convergence tolerance used as a stopping criterion. The exact
      definition of the criterion depends on the optimizer. The optimizer may
      choose to ignore this option.
    - Whether gradients should be evaluated early, even if the optimizer does
      not strictly need it yet. When evaluating on a distributed HPC cluster,
      this may lead to better load-balancing for some methods. This option is
      only applied if the optimization algorithm knows how to make use of it.
    - Whether calculations for functions and gradients should be done
      separately, even if the optimizer requests them to be evaluated together.
      This option is useful when a filter is specified that deactivates some
      realizations (see
      [`RealizationFilterConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.RealizationFilterConfig]).
      In this case, after evaluation of the functions, it may be possible to
      reduce the number of evaluations for a following gradient calculation.
    - Whether the optimizer may use parallelized function evaluations. This
      option currently only applies to gradient-free methods and may be ignored
      by the optimizer.
    - An optional location of an output directory, where the optimizer may store
      files.
    - Generic optimizer options that may be passed as an arbitrary dictionary,
      or as a list of strings. It depends on the method what form is required
      and how it is interpreted.

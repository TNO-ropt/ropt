class NonlinearConstraintsConfig(ImmutableBaseModel):
    r"""The configuration class for non-linear constraints.

    This class defines non-linear constraints configured by the
    `nonlinear_constraints` field in an
    [`EnOptConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.EnOptConfig] object.

    Non-linear constraints require that some constraint function is compared to
    a right-hand-side value, either for equality or inequality. The `rhs_values`
    field, which is a `numpy` array with a length equal to the number of
    constraint functions, provides the right-hand-side values.

    The `names` field is optional. If given, the number of constraint functions
    is set equal to its length. The `rhs_values` array will then be broadcasted
    to the number of constraint functions. For example, if `names = ["c1",
    "c2"]` and `rhs_values = 0.0`, the optimizer assumes two constraint
    functions and stores `rhs_values = [0.0, 0.0]`. If `names` is not set, the
    number of constraints is determined by the length of `rhs_values`.

    The `scales` field contains scaling values for the constraints. These values
    scale the constraint function values to a desired order of magnitude. Each
    time new constraint function values are obtained during optimization, they
    are divided by these values. The `auto_scale` field can be used to direct
    the optimizer to obtain additional scaling by multiplying the values of
    `scales` by the values of the constraint functions at the start of the
    optimization. Both the `scales` and `auto_scale` arrays will be broadcasted
    to have a size equal to the number of constraint functions.

    Info: Manual scaling and auto_scaling
        Both the `scales` values and the values obtained by auto-scaling will be
        applied. If `scales` is not supplied, auto-scaling will scale the
        constraints such that their initial values will be equal to one. Setting
        `scales` additionally allows for scaling to different initial values.

    The `types` field determines the type of each constraint: equality ($=$) or
    inequality ($\le$ or $\ge$), and is broadcasted to a length equal to the
    number of constraints. The `types` field is defined as an integer array, but
    its values are limited to those of the
    [`ConstraintType`][ropt.enums.ConstraintType] enumeration.

    The non-linear constraints may be subject to realization filters and
    function transforms. The `realization_filters` and `function_transform`
    fields contain indices to the realization filter or function transform
    objects to use. These objects are configured in the parent
    [`EnOptConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.EnOptConfig] object.

    Info: Calculating auto-scaling values
        For auto-scaling, the initial value of the constraint functions is used
        based on the assumption that it is calculated as a weighted sum from an
        ensemble of realizations, with weights specified by the `realizations`
        field in the [`EnOptConfig`][ropt.config.enopt.EnOptConfig] object. If
        the `realizations_filters` and/or `function_transforms` fields are also
        set, this assumption may not strictly hold; however, the scaling value
        will still be calculated in the same way for practical purposes.

        names:               The names of the constraint functions (optional).
        rhs_values:          The right-hand-side values.

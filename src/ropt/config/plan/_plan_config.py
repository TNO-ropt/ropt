class PlanStepConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for a single step within an optimization plan.

    A step represents a single action in the optimization process. It can
    access and modify plan variables, execute tasks such as optimization runs,
    and emit [`events`][ropt.plan.Event], for example, when intermediate
    optimization results are generated.

    The `run` string specifies the code that executes the step, and is used by
    the plugin manager to load the appropriate code.

    Additional parameters required by the step can be configured using the
    `with_` attribute, with its content varying based on the step type.

    Execution of the step can be made conditional by providing an expression
    through the `if_` attribute. This expression is evaluated, and the step is
    executed only if the result is `True`.

    Note: `with` and `if` aliases
        When parsing dictionaries into a `StepConfig` object, replace the
        `with_` attribute with `with`, and `if_` with `if` (without the
        underscore).

    Info: Conditional evaluation
        Conditions specified via the `if_` attribute are evaluated using the
        [`eval`][ropt.plan.Plan.eval] method of the plan object executing the
        steps. Refer to the method's documentation for more information on
        supported expressions.

        While mathematical expressions are generally evaluated using the
        `$eval()` function, this is optional for expressions passed via the
        `if_` attribute. For instance, `$eval(x > 0)` and `x > 0` are equivalent
        values for the `if_` attribute.

    Info: Alternative specification of the step config.
        The standard format for defining a step configuration follows the
        attribute-based structure shown here. Typically, a dictionary
        initializing a step would resemble:

        ```python
        {
            "run": "optimizer",
            "with": {
                "config": "$opt_config",
                "tags": "opt",
            }
            "if": "x > 0"
        }
        ```

        However, a pre-processing step allows a short-hand alternative notation,
        converting it into the above format before constructing the
        configuration object:

        ```python
        {
            "optimizer": {
                "config": "$opt_config",
                "tags": "opt",
            }
            "if": "x > 0"
        }

        For very simple steps that have only a single configuration field, this may
        even be simpler by just providing the value, like this:

        ```python
        {
            "print": "hello world!",
        }
        ```

        However, whereas first short-hand approach is generic and works for all
        steps, this last form may or may not be implemented the step. Consult
        the step documentation to make sure it works.

class ResultHandlerConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for a single result handler object.

    Result handler objects process events emitted by the steps of an
    optimization plan. These objects can receive [`events`][ropt.plan.Event]
    directly from the plan's steps, or from another result handler in a
    chain of handlers, as defined in the `results` section of a
    [`PlanConfig`][ropt.config.plan.PlanConfig] object. Upon receiving events,
    handlers may perform actions such as modifying plan variables, generating
    output, or updating the result objects included in the event.

    The `run` string specifies the code that initializes the result handler.
    This string is used by the plugin manager to load the handler's code.

    Additional parameters for the handler are configured using the `with_`
    attribute, which varies depending on the type of handler.

    Note: `with` is an alias for `with_`
        When parsing dictionaries into a `ResultHandlerConfig` object, the
        `with_` attribute should be replaced by `with` (without the underscore).

    The `failed_realizations` field is a boolean array that indicates for
    each realization whether the evaluation was successful or not.

    Depending on the type of objective or constraint calculation, the weights
    used for the realizations may change during optimization. This class stores
    for each objective and constraint a vector of weight values.

    All fields are two-dimensional matrices, where the first axis index denotes
    the function or constraint. The second axis index denotes the realization.

        failed_realizations: Failed realizations.
        objective_weights:   Realization weights for the objectives.

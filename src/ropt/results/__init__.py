"""Data classes for storing intermediate optimization results.

During the optimization process, functions and gradients are calculated and need
to be reported. To streamline this process, new results are passed to callbacks
as a tuple of [`Results`][ropt.results.Results] objects. These may be instances
of the derived [`FunctionResults`][ropt.results.FunctionResults] or
[`GradientResults`][ropt.results.GradientResults] classes, which contain results
for function and gradient evaluations, respectively.

These classes are nested `dataclasses` with several added features:

- **Scaling and Offsets**: Variables may have associated scaling and offset
  factors; if so, scaled values are also stored.
- **Objective and Constraint Scaling**: Objective and constraint function values
  may also have scaling factors, with scaled values stored as necessary.
- **Data Export Methods**: Functions are provided to export results to
  [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames or
  [`xarray`](https://xarray.dev/) datasets.
- **NetCDF Support**: Methods for reading and writing netCDF version 4 files
  using the [`netcdf4`](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/) Python
  package are included.

Much of the data stored in the result objects is multi-dimensional. For example,
the `objectives` field, which is part of the nested
[`evaluations`][ropt.results.FunctionEvaluations] object in the
[`FunctionResults`][ropt.results.FunctionResults], is a two-dimensional `numpy`
array. In this array, columns correspond to the objectives, and rows correspond
to the realization numbers.

To facilitate exporting and reporting results, the identity of the axes in such
multi-dimensional arrays is stored in metadata associated with the corresponding
field. These fields derive from the [`ResultField`][ropt.results.ResultField]
class, which includes a [`get_axes`][ropt.results.ResultField.get_axes] class
method to retrieve the axes. For example, for the `objectives` field, this
method retrieves the axes:

```py
>>> from ropt.results import FunctionEvaluations
>>> FunctionEvaluations.get_axes("objectives")
(<ResultAxis.REALIZATION: 'realization'>, <ResultAxis.OBJECTIVE: 'objective'>)
```

Using this metadata, the exporting or reporting code can refer to the optimizer
configuration to associate realization and objective names with any entry in the
result matrix. For instance, the [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
exporting code will utilize this information to construct a multi-index for the
generated DataFrame and may also unstack such multi-dimensional data into
multiple columns.
